glabel-wipe 0.0.4

chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>:Wilfried Kopp <wilfried@parity.io

Allows wiping all labels in a repo. Definitely not a safe command, this is why should consider twice
before using it. If **some** labels are used in your issues, PRs, you probably should NOT be doing a
wipe

USAGE:
    glabel wipe [FLAGS] --token <TOKEN> <REPOSITORY>

ARGS:
    <REPOSITORY>    The repo string for now in the form owner/repo such as chevdor/foobar

FLAGS:
    -a, --apply      By default, for your safety, the command will NOT do anything. If you however
                     pass this flag, there will be no way back :) It is highly recommended to call
                     `get` first and backup your labels but keep in mind that it does not save which
                     labels are applied to PRs and issues. So if you have labels "in use", you will
                     lose them
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -V, --version    Print version information

OPTIONS:
    -t, --token <TOKEN>    If you follow good security practices, your GITHUB_TOKEN should not have
                           write access to your repos. Here since we need to write labels, we use
                           another variable for the token with write access. It is highly
                           recommended to pass this as an Environment variable [env: TOKEN=<your
                           admin token>]
