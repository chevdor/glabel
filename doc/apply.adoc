Apply a label set from a given file

Usage: glabel apply [OPTIONS] --token <TOKEN> <REPOSITORY> <INPUT>

Arguments:
  <REPOSITORY>  The repo string for now in the form owner/repo such as chevdor/foobar
  <INPUT>       The filename where your set is stored

Options:
  -t, --token <TOKEN>  If you follow good security practices, your GITHUB_TOKEN should not have write access to your repos. Here since we need to write labels, we use another variable for the token with write access. It is highly recommended to pass this as an Environment variable [env: TOKEN=<your admin token>]
  -r, --replace        By default, existing labels will NOT be updated. If you set this flag to true, they will. Beware, there is no automatic backup so it could be a good idea to run the `get` command first and make a backup
  -d, --dry-run        Do not change anything, print only what will be done
  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version
