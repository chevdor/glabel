glabel-apply 0.0.1



Apply a label set

USAGE:
    glabel apply [FLAGS] --token <TOKEN> <REPOSITORY> <INPUT>

ARGS:
    <REPOSITORY>    The repo string for now in the form owner/repo such as chevdor/foobar
    <INPUT>         The filename where your set is stored

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -j, --json       Output as json
    -V, --version    Print version information

OPTIONS:
    -t, --token <TOKEN>    If you follow good security practices, your GITHUB_TOKEN should not have
                           write access to your repos. Here since we need to write labels, we use
                           another variable for the token with write access. It is highly
                           recommended to pass this as an Environment variable [env: TOKEN=<your
                           admin token>]
