== Intro

A utility to import (=`get`) and export (=`apply`) Github labels.

== Install

    cargo install --git https://github.com/chevdor/glabel --locked
    glabel --help

You may also enable the `wipe` feature but bare in mind that it comes with a rather high risk unless you know well what you are doing.
